# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email security@google.com with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

We prefer receiving reports via this email over GitHub issues to ensure that we can address vulnerabilities discreetly and responsibly before disclosing them publicly.
