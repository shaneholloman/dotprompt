# Requirements for this workflow:
#
# 1. Secrets must be configured in the repository settings:
#    - OSSRH_USERNAME: The username for Sonatype OSSRH (Maven Central).
#    - OSSRH_TOKEN: The password or token for Sonatype OSSRH.
#    - MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY: The ASCII-armored GPG private key for signing artifacts.
#    - MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE: The passphrase for the GPG private key.
#
# 2. GPG Key Formatting:
#    - The private key should be exported using: `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <ID>`
#    - Ensure the key has no empty lines or formatting issues when pasted into GitHub Secrets.
